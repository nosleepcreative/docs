## AE Naming Convention Style Guide

**Naming Details**

* When not using scene-shot naming convention, give sufficient details to your name such as indicating direction of motion, colors, etc.

> Why? Naming sequentially via number or letters is not helpful in helping users identify what the composition is, especially if you aren’t working with a sequential narrative; different deliverables requires different specifications and naming convention.

*

Dashes vs Underscore

* Dashes for chaining details
* Underscore separate details

## Version Control for Design

* How do you manage version control for developing designs and explorations?

**What is Version Control in software development?**

Version control is a method that record modifications as they occur, facilitating collaborative effort among multiple developers on a single project. It preserves a chronological log of changes, ensuring that specific version can be accesses and restored whenever necessary.

&#x20;**Why is relevant to visual design?**

* Collaborative
