# Designful life

_You do not think your thoughts, you think your culture thoughts. —_ Gregory Bateson

>

‌

Maybe the solution is this thing called a designer lifestyle; **low commitment ludic discipline / lifestyle.** You have to question what you love to do again and what you are less inclined to do. There are questions you should avoid as well such as "what is my style".

‌

How do we ask better questions and address our needs? How can we create something that people do not know that they wanted eg.Spotify, iPod, iPhone, facebook,

‌

**Keywords**: precision of language, specific, succinct, positioning, reframing, lifestyle, consistency?

‌

## Discovering ourselves

### Thought patterns

* I am not good enough
* I do not think I am worth that much / I'm asking too much

**Possible thoughts**

* I do not have a style
* I do not know what to make
* I do not know what I am trying to say
* Overwhelmed by creatives on social media
* I don't want to commit to anything because what if it goes wrong
* I cannot see how I How does have a style brings value to my portfolio and creative career?

‌

We are more concerned with aesthetics than how things look then how things performed hence **form over function.**

‌

**Questions we might be ask ourselves**

‌

* What is perceived as effective when measuring a creative's skillset
* What are you interested in and curious about?
* What do you love and are passionate about?
* What keeps you up at night?

‌

**Symptoms**: tense / grip in my heart / demotivated / frustrated / overwhelmed by people's success on social media

‌

Define finding a style does not really excite me > what's the point? It does not do anything. I would like a problem to solve. For most part of my life, I have been a thinker and builder ; not much of a maker. my talent is consistency; small things done daily

exit: ⌘↩

My problem that I always fall into is identifying myself with a conventional motion designer that are characterized by illustrative, geometric, smooth motion, 3D visual language. However, I am not inclined to do those things even if I can do it

So the bigger question that oyu

Develop when I was showering, i caught myself thinking about expressions and using processing to enhance what I can do; doesn't that say a thing about my "style"

## FAQs

‌

### **Sample: How do we develop a healthy lifestyle?**

‌

* D: How often do you snack? Do you live a sedentary lifestyle? Have you been exercising? How many hours do you sleep? What time do you go to bed?
* S: \*proceeds to defend his character by saying "he should exercise or do this or that"
* D: I did not ask what you should do but what do you think of your lifestyle that you are living? What do you think would happen if you keep this up in a year or five or ten years. If you develop some health problems, what are the repercussions you will face? eg. prone to illness or diseases, incur high medical fees, who is going to pay for those fee? Who is going to take care of you? At what age do you expect to live until with this lifestyle?
* D: Do you take your health seriously?
* S: \*will most probably say yes as an automatic response but does not realize the weight of the question
* D: If you take it seriously, then why are you not doing anything about it? So let me ask you again: do you take your health seriously. If you do, what are you going to do about it?
* S: \* gives vague answers such as exercise or eating more vegetables
* D: that's not good enough. How often are you going to exercise? What will you cut out of your diet? Most importantly, when will you start? How will you commit to what you say you will do. What happens if you do not do what you set yourself out to do.
* S: \*answers "tomorrow"

‌

> The next day (scenario: S did not follow up what he promised)

‌

* D: how goes your exercise / new lifestyle?
* S: I did not do it
* D: why not? You said you would do it. You can lie to me but do not lie to yourself. The end.

‌

### 🌱 How do we get inspired consistently or fuel our imagination?

‌

What are your intentions for getting inspired?

‌

* I want to get better at my craft by making **innovative** design solutions or aesthetics
* it's part breaking new ground and also developing a healthy consistent "diet"

exit: ⌘↩

1. **look** **elsewhere** where no one is looking - avoid homogenization
   * look at sth you never usually do - random point of departure
2. **look deeper and observe**
   * Rather than relying serendipty to find new sources, focus deeply on a single subject matter or artist. Being more informed than others is definitely better than being an amalgamation of random things.
3. Ask yourself what are you curious about

### How can we get "motivated" / get started on personal projects?

> The author and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry on motivating others:"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast endless sea."Source: James Clear / Citadelle

‌

* **Personal projects**
  * Why do you want to do personal projects?
  * What are you expecting out these personal projects?
    * of course we want to get better but what would be a tangible result of success? How do you quantify and measure your success?
  * You said you have been wanting to do personal projects for awhile now. How much time can you commit each week/day?
* What is the first thing you will work on when you get this creative personal time?
* When will you start?
* Freelancing
  * what do you know about freelancing? Invoice , contracts , payment methods , how to get consistent leads , how will you grow your business, communicating with clients?

‌

### How do you get better at what you do?

exit: ⌘↩

Learning to become a better artist is no different from training yourself to be an athlete. We can see creativity as a muscle to be trained and strengthen with a well-planned consistent 'workout' routine.

‌

* Teach - teaching is learning something twice

‌

### How do we step out of our comfort zones to make something new?

‌

**Get uncomfortable -** Make 5 variables you are uncomfortable with eg, time, tools, colors, subject matter, typeIntroduce one of them as a constraint in your next project eg. you cannot use the same typeface that you always do; try something different**Do a master copy -** Copy a design that you love to learn a new visual vocabulary[Matthew Encina Copywork Challenge](https://youtu.be/By-\_gbXjEEM)

## Rest / Creative Sabbatical

‌

I recently got reminded by **Stefan Sagmeister** and his creative sabbatical in which he takes a year off every 7 years of working. It got me thinking about how we can do a micro-version of this practice by **taking the last week of the month off.** That means not doing dailies, not watching tutorials or anything creatively strenuous. Perhaps take stock of where you are and what you have done for the month. Evaluate, plan and execute.

‌

One thing to note about Sagmeister's practice is that he planned thoroughly how he spend his sabbatical to learn and do his projects. (-Time Sensitive Podcast)

The questions to all these statements would be **"who doesn't".** The problems with the people on the top is how they often described how they reached success in broad loose terms with no clear actionable plan. It is fine to talk in terms as long as enough context is built with case studies or personal anecdotes. There is no one size-fit-all answer. Answers are going to change for person to person. **It starts with diagnosing our needs and investigating our wants, and developing a bridge between those two.**

* What do you need right now?
* Where do you want to work ?
* Who do you want to work for?
* When do you plan to achieve what you set yourself out to do?
* What risks can I take right now?
* what is best fit for you instead of aiming what people deemed best ?
* what are my expectations of myself or ...?
* what is success to me?
* **Company**
  * How do you positioning yourself as outstanding way compared to locals The work is important but it's also how you communicate about your work, strategies, ideas, how you defend them
