# Abstract
If you're just starting to learn JSX and expressions in React, it can be overwhelming to remember all the syntax and concepts involved. That's why I've created this JSX cheatsheet as a quick reference guide to help you when you get stuck.

## Declaration
To declare a variable in JavaScript, use the var keyword followed by the variable name.
You can declare multiple variables in one line by separating them with a comma.
```
var myVariable;
var 🍎,🍐,🍊;
```

## Initialization

To initialize a variable, assign a value to it using the = operator.
You can initialize an array with multiple values using square brackets [] and separating the values with commas.

```
var fruit = 🍎;
var fruitArray = [🍏,🍎,🍐,🍊,🍋,🍌,🍉,🍇];
```

## String
Strings are used to represent text in JavaScript.

"string is text"
## For-Loops
For-loops are used to iterate over a block of code multiple times.

```
for (var i = 0; i < value; i++) {
  statement
}
```

##If/Else Statements
If/else statements are used to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.

```
if (fruit) {
  statement
} else {
  statement
}
```

## Shorthand If Statement
The shorthand if statement is used when you want to return a value based on a condition.

```
if (x == 1) 10;
```

## Ternary
Ternary operations are a shorthand way to write if/else statements and return a value based on a condition.

```
x = (y >= 5) ? 20  50;
```

## Object
Objects in JavaScript are used to store collections of key/value pairs.

```
var x = { firstName "John", lastName "Doe" };
```

## Regular Expressions (Regex)
Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.
```
"\n"
```

## Single Line Comment
Single line comments are used to add comments to your code that will not be executed.
```
// This is a single line comment
```

## Multi-Line Comment
Multi-line comments are used to add comments to your code that span multiple lines.
```
/* This is a 
multi-line comment 
that spans multiple lines */
```
