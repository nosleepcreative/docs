* lengthen a clip in the middle of video without cutting or trimming time of other clips: If you hold down the CTRL key while dragging the IN or OUT point of a clip, it will move everything else accordingly. When putting mouse cursor over end of clip, it should turn to a red bracket when in position to extend clip end â€“ press CTRL and it turns yellow and then it will ripple. If you make a mistake, CTRL-Z undo, so no worries.
