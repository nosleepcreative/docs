# Professional Etiquettes

## E-mail Etiquette by Professor Dominique Elliott

### **General:**

* **#1: e-mail NEVER goes away:** Once you hit the Send key, your e-mail is there for all humanity to see… until the end of times.
* **#2: It can be very hard to judge the tone of an e-mail.**You need to be much more careful than in oral communication, not less.
* \#3: chances are it may be forwarded to someone it was not intended for.

### **Email formatting**

* Write a clear subject line
* Write a salutation, even on replies
* Keep it brief
* Don’t text message
* Bullet your main points or action items when appropriate

### **Courtesy**

* Always respond
* Respond quickly
* Take time to proofread (punctuation, grammar, spelling)
* Consolidate your e-mails. Don’t e-mail someone 4 times an hour.

Think about the questions you need answers to.

### **Professionalism**

* Use emoticons only if you feel it clarifies tone, in a professional manner. Not advisable to a superior.
* Avoid discussing private matters/issues.
* Remain positive in your tone.
* Do not blame others.

### **Tone**

#### **Always double-check your tone. The difference between:**

> “ If you ever get this project done….”

and

> “ When you get the project done…”

#### Bottom line: Before you hit send, ask yourself if you would speak the same way in person.

If you are on the receiving line of an aggressive e-mail, breathe, stay polite and diffuse the situation. Try to move the conversation to another forum.

> “I’m sorry you feel this way. Perhaps we could discuss it in person (or over the phone).”
