# Marxism, Reproduction and Aura

Marx, "Capital" excerpt;&#x20;


●	Utility = value ≠  the amount of labour required  ≠ & = commodity presents use value and exchange value

●	Labour twofold nature - use value cannot confront each other...

●	Bodies of commodities = matter + labour

●	Value in commodity A exist in relation to commodity B

●	Labour creating value for a product is a value itself

Benjamin, "The Work of Art in the age of Mechanical Reproduction";&#x20;


●	No identical reproduction in a work of art due its missing presence in time and space

●	Aura of art is reduced when it is mechanically reproduced

●	Uniqueness = inseparable from its being imbedded in the fabric of tradition

●	Films makes you unable to think; your thoughts are replaced by moving images compared to an arrest by a painting

●	Public is an examiner, but an absent-minded one

Critique of Digital Capitalism Chapter 3

●	Illusion of infinite resources of the digital production without any real expenditure

●	Aura of info: separation of the meaning present in a work from the physical representation of that work

●	Capitalist paradox of escalating value - constant demand to create more commodity value in order to extract more wealth from society ….

●	Digital copies are all identical originals

●	Rejection of real expenditures required…

●	Limit of a digital work not based on time but rather on its availability within contemporary tech. Obsolete > emulation

●	Digital - accumulation and management problems

●	Illusion that digital is immaterial

●	Reproduction is the source and vehicle for a work’s aura

●	Aura of digital suggests magical production without consumption =  digital capitalism and elision of capitalism

●	Abbing: Art became less obscure, more accessible and thus less magical because of technical reproduction

●	Aura is extended through copies rather than diminishing. Authenticity becomes a meaningful value once there are reproductions of an art work, similar but identical in appearance to their source

●	Art with dual nature: history testimony  and the relationship of that object to the tradition that produced it = physical and spectator’s knowledge

●	Uniqueness of IP: right to read than own a copy

Conclusions

●	Theories are lenses that help to see, analyse, and dissect our world. There is no “correct” theories but ones that help us see things with clarity better.
