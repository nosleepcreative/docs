Simulations

**Tier 1**

* The simulacrum is never that which conceals the truth - it is the truth which conceals that there is none
* We confuse the _map_ as being the real
* **Simulacrum**: is reflection of a basic reality, masks and perverts a basic reality, masks the absence of a basic reality, it bears no relation to any reality whatever: it is its own pure simulacrum
* Orders of simulacra: Counterfeit / Production / Simulation
* Public opinion = hyperreal - lives only off of montage and test-manipulation
* Polls as a simulacrum of public opinions; do we really know its verity, influence, accuracy in representation?
* The unreal is no longer that of dream of fantasy of a beyond a within, it is that of a _hallucinatory resemblance of the real within itself._

**Tier 2**

* Disneyland - suspension of the real and into the imaginary world. Make us believe that the rest is real, when actually everything else are no longer real, but of **the order of the hyperreal and of simulation**
* **Watergate -** a simulation of a scandal to regenerative ends
* A fake hold-up / robbery - lead to people perceiving as the real due to how the established order is (Southland tales?)
* Hyperreality and simulation are deterrents of every principle and of every objective
* Production as a restoration of the real which escapes it.Contemporary production is itself hyperreal.
* Television watches you: implosion of meaning = simulation begins
* War is peace
* All media and the official news service only exist to maintain the illusion of actuality
* Reality itself, entirely impregnated by an aesthetic which is inseparable from its own structure, has been confused with its own image > reality is not reality because we live our lives with simulations

**Conclusion**

* Hyperreal cannot be broken for there is no basis in reality; but it is ubiquitous everywhere. We already live in an esthetic hallucination of reality. Truman show might be a good example of this fabricated-domed reality; everything seems real on the surface but is not when you look behind, it was just an illusion.
