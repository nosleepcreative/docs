# Post Cinematic Affect

## **Post-Cinematic Affect**

Post-Cinematic Affect is about what it feels like to live in the affluent West in the early 21st century. Specifically, it explores the structure of feeling that is emerging today in tandem with new digital technologies, together with economic globalization and the financialization of more and more human activities. The 20th century was the age of film and television; these dominant media shaped and reflected our cultural sensibilities. In the 21st century, new digital media help to **shape and reflect new forms of sensibility.** Movies (moving image and sound works) continue to be made, but they have adopted new formal strategies, they are viewed under massively changed conditions, and they address their spectators in different ways than was the case in the 20th century. The book traces these changes, focusing on four recent moving-image works: Nick Hooker's music video for Grace Jones' song Corporate Cannibal; Olivier Assayas' movie Boarding Gate, starring Asia Argento; Richard Kelly's movie Southland Tales, featuring Justin Timberlake, Dwayne Johnson, and other pop culture celebrities; and Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor's Gamer

Affect - influence something or make a different too

Simply put, the theory is about **what it feels like to live in affluent west in the 21st century**. It talks about an emergence of a different media regime where media reflects reality, and that it addresses the audience differently than in 20th century; shaping new ways of response. The world that we live is a world of hypermediacy, and ubiquitous digital technologies. It is abstraction of social processes but they do not represent them entirely

Examples of hypermediacy: Mosaic of Kali Yuga, Requiem of a dream, Deadpool, Kill the Ego

## What I will be doing:

A short film using live-action footage to create a nightmarish montage about our contemporary world system. The imagery will irrational things we do these days; buying what you want but what you donâ€™t need, defensive mechanisms, overthinking and inaction, overwork and unexamined, etc. All of which will be used to remind viewers of the medium that they are watching. Eg.

experience of the medum is itself an experience of the real and authentic

**Course Project**

Because this course is not only concerned with your knowledge and understanding of critical theory, but your ability to apply it to your own work, this course requires the production of a project. Typically this project is an adaptation of what you study for your term paper, but does not necessarily have to be based on your term paper research.

The project is the adaptation and application of some theory we examine in this course, either in a lecture, or through the term paper, and then used in the production of a finished work. This project is broken into several stages based on the work flow typical to media production, but these data points in the process can be adapted as needed to suit projects different from animations, motion graphics or visual effects-type work. Such variances are encouraged, but should be discussed before you start working on them.

You are encouraged to produce an innovative, interesting project in this course, and experimental projects that fall outside the parameters of standard media work are encouraged.

This project must be documented in a process book, showing the development of the ideas and the application of the theory chosen for the production of the project. Students are expected to be pro-active on their own behalf, working and developing their paper/project on their own. If you have a concern or problem, it is your reponsibility to come see the professor.

When preparing documentation of projects that are non-traditional, please bear in mind that your project should be no longer than you would be willing to sit through if it was someone else's work. Please try to confine your length to 5 minutes or less.

Benchmark 1: Pitch (Project Proposal Presentation)

Length: 5 minutes Due: Class 6

Instructions: You will have five (5) minutes to present. Have an explanation for what you want to do for your project, so get to the point! Any materials that will help explain what you want to do should be part of your presentation, such as tentative storyboards, mood boards, concept sketches or other visual aids to make your proposal understandable are highly encouraged (and required). Use an appropriate presentation software such as Microsoft PowerPoint to prepare your presentation; Adobe Acrobat is not appropriate for presentations.

Benchmark 2: Storyboard & Mood Boards / Proof of Concept Due: Class 9 in Dropbox

Please schedule time to meet outside class if needed.

Benchmark 3: Animatic/Alpha Version

Due: Class 12 in Dropbox

Please schedule time to meet outside class if needed.

Benchmark 4: Description of Theory Use

Length: 1-2 pp, print out to hand-in DUE: Class 15

This is a short paper discussing specifically what the theory you are using in your project is, how it has been used, and making the connection between that theory and your project explicit.

This statement is brief: it must get to the point with a minimum of verbiage and be explicit about what and how the connection between theory and practice has been made in your project; it is an essential part of your course project.

Benchmark 5: Roughcut / Beta Version Presentation Due: Class 15 in dropbox; will screen in class

This is a presentation of the rough cut in class. Please dress appropriately. You do not need to prepare a powerpoint explaining your project, but you should have a presentation to show your progress. Expect this class to be a group crit of what you have actually done for the project.

Benchmark 6: Finished Project Presentation and Process Book

Length: up to 5 minutes

Due: Class 20 on your flashdrive/DVD to hand-in

As your course project is primarily about the process of taking your theory and developing a project based on your understanding, you will need to document the design and development process in a process book.

A Process Book includes all your notes, sketches, ideas, annotations on your research and design concepts for the project. At a minimum, this should cover a description of the theory, your brainstorming and concept development, as well as notes related to the implementation of the project.

While a fully realized project may be impossible (as with some animation and interactive design work), students are expected to attempt to produce their project as fully as possible within the constraints of the class. This process book documents this work, and so is an essential part of your finished project.

All final completed work for this class will be handed in as both a print-out (for written material) and on a flashdrive or Data- DVD for all written, visual materials, presentations and other material. Flashdrives/DVDs will not be returned.

Checklist of Materials to Hand-in:

(1) a print out of the final paper and the draft paper

(2) an electronic copy (.pdf or .doc) of the final paper (on the flashdrive or DVD)

(3) your final project (on the flashdrive or DVD)

(4) a digital copy of your process book (on the flashdrive or DVD)

(5) electronic copies of all your handed-in summaries (on the flashdrive or DVD)

(6) a flashdrive or DVD with all files burned to it

(7) all media has the Project Slate Template, included in the Dropbox to identify any project video you hand-in at
