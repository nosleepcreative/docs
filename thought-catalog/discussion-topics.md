### Why work so hard now when you are going to work for the rest of your life?

Abstract: The next best thing you are chasing right now is always going to change as you proceed with life. You will never feel the satisfaction of "arrival", and your perception, needs, wants are all going to **change as we go.** In essence, we are in a perpetual cycle of always living "incomplete".

* What are your thoughts on how hard you should work.
* Should you work hard&#x20;

Desmond: I believe we tend to bifurcate work and leisure, and label work as a drudgery / something unpleasant we must get through to survive. We need to start seeing this&#x20;

Also, how hard we work will change as we grow older and take on new responsibilities and obligations such as having a family or starting a business. It is a spectrum. Ultimately, I believe it is a matter of how comfortable you want to be in life or what is the level of discomfort can you tolerate
