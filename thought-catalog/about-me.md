## About

Hello! My name is **Desmond Du**,  I am a multi-media artist based in Savannah, Georgia specializing in **After Effects**, **procedural methods, coding** and **automation**. I enjoy teaching and runs a software tutorials YouTube channel called [**NoSleepCreative**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAOBiw0BBjKgFyHDuoCeTXQ?view\_as=subscriber).

I have been running NoSleepCreative Wiki since 2019 summer. I update this wiki almost every single day (mostly the expressions). Everything here is a work-in-progress so you will find holes and incomplete materials in certain pages. I like to call this my online brain.

## FAQs

**What do you do when you feel stuck?**

Usually I need a consciousness or cognition shift to overcome, and I often do this by talking to my closest motion design friends, and explained the situation. They usually do not have the answers but still offer suggestions. I believe it is not about getting the right answers but actually the process of talking it out your problem and brainstorming together.
