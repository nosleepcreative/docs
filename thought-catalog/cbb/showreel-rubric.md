# Portfolio / Showreel

## **Abstract**

In late 2019, I saw a senior motion designer position at my company; and thought to myself what it takes to be one. I don't think it was a matter of technical skills because everyone on my team seems to able to perform at similar levels. That's when I thought to myself that it was a matter of "experience and the 'eye'; it means being able to spot mistakes and have confidence to approve a design . That is why I decided to write my own guide of what I deemed is good as a way of training my understanding of what it takes to be a senior level designer.

Above is good way to set parameters for what makes a work good.

## **FAQs**

1. _**I did a project collaboration in which I was responsible for secondary elements (eg. background) but the production values lies in the the 3D rendering and animation that was not done by me. Can I still put that shot in my reel?**_
   * You have to ask yourself what are the implications of putting that shot in the reel:
     * Clients or employers will definitely ask if you did the 3D stuff or if you can recreate it
     * You are promoting your peer's work rather than yours so he/she will get the job instead
     * You are highlighting your weakness rather your strength; you are wasting screen time to showcase your skills and talents!&#x20;
2. _**My peers want to put a shot from a collaborative project you did together in his/her reel even though you were the one responsible for more than 80%  for that shot. Should I give them permission?**_
   * The situation is reversed now in this case and so is the answer. If they want to put it in their reel sure; **they are promoting your work.**
   * However, do have your peer credit you for that shot wherever he or she post the work eg.website process page or showreel video description.
