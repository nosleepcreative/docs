# Welcome to NoSleepCreative

## Updates:

12 October 2020 - Some of my content here are disappearing as I am migrating them into my private Notion database for easier curation. Not to worry, everything related to Motion Design will remain here.

## ABOUT

**A site dedicated to curating knowledge pertaining to Motion Design: a discipline that fuses graphic design, animation, film-making and everything I know to help you lead better lives!** I have too many thoughts these days; and I love writing.  This is where I channel all my ideas, best practices or theories about life I neologized. I wouldn't call this a blog but rather a **virtual copy of my brain;** a place where I can evaluate my thoughts, built upon them, and crystallize them into valuable knowledge.&#x20;

## Why share knowledge?

Why the hell not?? Sharing is caring. Here at **NoSleepCreative,** we share and mapped out curated knowledge in accessible online format that students and professionals can used alike in the Motion Design and art industry.

## Why a database format?

For about 4 years I been trying to find a way to curate knowledge in the most efficient way while still updating it as I hone my artistic skills. I experimented with various platforms such as a Wordpress website, Notion , Google Docs, and even Mediawiki, all to no avail. Gitbook comes closest to what I have been looking for in terms of user interface and design; a database for crystallizing knowledge.

Matt and his [cgwiki](http://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=Main\_Page) database explains it the best:&#x20;

> Rather than keep it in a paper notebook I've stored it online in a wiki, which you're looking at now., it's a little disorganised and messy, you'll find things scribbled in the margins, sketches of ideas, shopping lists etc.It's not a manual, it's not official software documentation, quality varies depending on my stress levels at the time of writing. Hopefully most of it is interesting and/or useful.

In short, it is my peers and my manifesto to approaching to art and design.&#x20;

## The importance of a database in an organization: a collective brain

* Knowledge bubbles > Database model  — We do not know what we know and do not know
* Help us better identify and evaluate what we all know and don’t know
* Ultimately, increasing 'operational agility'
* Re-use and update for training new hires / freelancers / understudies / people stepping into a higher position
* Curate best practices
  * for communicating within teams & managers
  * file naming conventions
  * workflow for different types of projects
  * for software usage eg. C4D, Resolve, Houdini
  * Things project managers want the design team to know (vice versa)
  * Curation of data: deliverable and formats
