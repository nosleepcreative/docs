## About NoSleepCreative

Hello! I'm [**Desmond Du**](https://www.duitbetter.com), a Motion Designer/Creative Technologist based in New York City.&#x20;

Welcome to NoSleepCreative Wiki. I established this platform in late 2019 as a complement to my [NoSleepCreative YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/NoSleepCreative). Here, my focus is on curating knowledge related to Motion Design, with a particular emphasis on JSX expression coding and technology.&#x20;

I occasionally update this wiki when I get some free time or actively use the site for new expression snippets.

## Origins

This wiki project started in 2015. After experimenting with platforms like WordPress, Notion, Google Docs, and Mediawiki for about four years, I finally found what I was looking for in 2019 with Gitbook, which offered the ideal interface and design for curating knowledge while honing my artistic skills.\


I was very much inspired by Matt and his [cgwiki](http://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=Main\_Page) database explains the importance and structure of the wiki:

> Rather than keep it in a paper notebook I've stored it online in a wiki, which you're looking at now., it's a little disorganised and messy, you'll find things scribbled in the margins, sketches of ideas, shopping lists etc.It's not a manual, it's not official software documentation, quality varies depending on my stress levels at the time of writing. Hopefully most of it is interesting and/or useful.

## Changelog

* **2020.10.12:** Some of my content here are disappearing as I am migrating them into my private Notion database for easier curation. Not to worry, everything related to Motion Design will remain here.
* **2023.09.16:** Added GIFs for snippet and rewrote expressions for clarity, added change log, clean up Welcome page
